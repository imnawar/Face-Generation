# Face-Generation
This is the fourth project in [Udacity's Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). According to the original [repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning), DCGAN is used to produce new and realistic images of human faces based on the CelebA dataset.

**The goal of this project is to train a DCGAN to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible from a dataset of faces.**
